                <p class="additionally"> - cheating on the work of other students being evaluated;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - re-submission, delivery of already evaluated work;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - presentation of false excuses in case of non-fulfillment, late completion of the evaluated work;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - the performance of the assessed work by two or more students, which does not provide for group work;</p>

                <p>5.1.4 Plagiarism, i.e. the appropriation of ideas, data or texts without specifying their authorship, i.e. the presentation of other people's ideas as their own. Plagiarism can manifest itself in various forms:</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - quoting a source without using appropriate punctuation (quotation marks) and/or without specifying the source;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - rephrasing the source without specifying the source;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - using someone's ideas or arguments without reference to the author;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - submission of a written paper written in whole or in part by a friend or another student;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - presentation of a term paper/thesis taken from the Internet;</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - presentation of a course paper that was completed as an assignment for another course.</p>
                <p class="additionally"> - Academic bribery, i.e. giving remuneration for academic services (personal or group).</p>
                <p>5.2. Violations of ethical standards of scientific activity are not considered, in particular, unconscious research errors, data conflict, as well as different interpretations of research results.</p><br>
                <h3><b>VI. Familiarization with the Code of Academic Ethics, compliance with its requirements and control over its implementation</b></h3>
                <p>6.1. This Code is published after its adoption and is widely accessible to members of the academic community. New students are familiarized with the requirements of the Code.</p>
                <p>6.2. Each member of the academic community is obliged to comply with the requirements of this Code.</p><br>
                <h3><b>Responsibility and penalties</b></h3>
                <p>Participants in the educational process should remember that they are morally responsible for violating the principles of academic integrity. Plagiarism, the purchase and sale of term papers, theses is considered as going beyond a simple violation of the rules and is perceived as a serious violation against the community and entails punishment for using other people's materials. Teachers record each case of violation, and the student's current or final work is not allowed to be evaluated. The student is reprimanded, then up to expulsion. Teachers ensure that students are informed that students' work is checked for plagiarism using a web-based system.</p><br>
                <h3><b>VII. Final provisions</b></h3>
                <p>7.1. This Code comes into force the day after its approval by the College's Teaching Council and must be immediately published in such a way that all members of the College's academic community have access to it.</p><br>
