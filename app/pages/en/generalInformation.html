Life has proved Mikhail Alexandrovich right, and today the college staff maintains close contact with many enterprises of the city and region.</p>

Kavaz Almagambetovich is an incredibly hardworking and cheerful person who energized everyone around him with his energy. He was distinguished by his dedication to his work, sensitive attitude to anyone in need of help. Thanks to his organizational talent and innovative approach to business, the college has become one of the leading secondary specialized educational institutions in Kazakhstan. During the years of his leadership, a tradition was born in our educational institution - to honor veterans. Teachers and students of the college reverently honor this tradition: after all, only where they respect their history, real professionals are born. patriots of their country.</p>

        <div class="picture"><img src="img/picturecollege3.png" alt=""></div><br>
        <p>The 90s in the history of the college, as well as in the whole country, were the most difficult and disturbing. The financial and economic crisis, a decrease in the state order for training specialists, salary delays, problems with heating and electricity supply - all this, combined with a sharp decrease in interest in secondary vocational education, jeopardized the very existence of the educational institution. But the team survived this time with dignity, retaining its main purpose – to train specialists for the country's economy.</p>
        <p>Despite all the difficulties inextricably linked with the history of our state and society, in difficult years, thanks to the high competence of Director Ermagambetov Temirgali Sultanovich, experience and outstanding organizational skills, the educational institution stood up, continued to recruit students and made a significant contribution to the development of secondary vocational education in the Kostanay region.</p>
        <p>Currently, the college is a multidisciplinary educational institution, which, taking into account the requirements of the modern labor market, trains personnel in the most popular specialties. The College continues to train highly qualified specialists in the field of power supply, grain storage and processing technology, bakery technology, economics, standardization, technical operation of electromechanical equipment, maintenance of machinery and equipment of elevator production.</p>
        <p>Over the years of our educational institution's existence, strong partnerships have developed with large and small grain processing enterprises, where our students undergo educational and industrial practice. Students, graduates of our college, after completing their internship, receive invitations to permanent work at such enterprises of the city as Agromashholding, Ivolga LLP, Bayan – Sulu JSC, Zhas–Argyn LLP, Altyn-nan LLP, Kostanay Flour Mill JSC.</p><br>
        <div class="picture"><img src="img/picturecollege4.png" alt=""></div><br>
        <p>To date, more than 30 enterprises of the city and the region are ready to accept graduates of our college. The college administration is negotiating with enterprises to expand the base of practices and increase the competitiveness of graduates.</p>
        <p>The biggest reward for any team is to see the fruits of their labor. Today we are proud to say that over 50 years our college has trained more than 30 thousand specialists who work at enterprises in the city, in rural regions, in CIS countries and abroad. Among the graduates are heads of large enterprises, heads of workshops, specialists who have made a significant contribution to the development of the grain processing industry. Over 45 years of operation, our educational institution has earned universal recognition and respect in the system of personnel training for the country's economy.</p>
        <p>The task of training competitive specialists in demand in the labor market helps to solve the constant desire of teachers to improve their professional skills. The engineering and teaching staff of the college actively uses new learning technologies, conducts research, defends master's and PhD theses, and works on the creation of electronic textbooks in special disciplines.</p>
        <p>The innovative activity of the team allows you to react mobile to all changes in the education system, in the field of vocational education. The strategic direction of the college's development is the system of continuing education: the department of working specialties, college, university. Currently, the college has created conditions for the progressive development of students' professional competencies. Graduates of the Department of working specialties have the opportunity to continue their studies at college and higher educational institutions. The competitive advantages of our educational institution allow graduates to be in demand in the labor market.</p>
