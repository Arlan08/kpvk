        <p>The educational process at the college is organized in the following forms:</p>
        <p class="additionally">classroom classes: lectures, practical classes (seminars, colloquiums), laboratory or studio classes;</p>
        <p class="additionally">Lecture classes are classes that have an organizing and guiding role in the educational process. Lectures should acquaint students with the basics of the chosen specialty, develop students' ability and need for independent and in-depth work in practical, seminar, laboratory, studio classes and industrial practice. The lectures should cover the most important program material that defines the basis for training specialists, while the details can be omitted and attributed to the independent work of students. Lectures should be accompanied by demonstration materials in the form of posters, slides, video presentations, etc.</p>
        <p class="additionally">Practical classes are a type of classes that are conducted in student groups or in subgroups (according to the decision of the PCC) and provide for a more in-depth study of the material of lecture courses. At the same time, a part of the program material is assimilated that does not require scientific and theoretical justification. In all these cases, the chairmen of the PCC should take care of maintaining the system and methodological integrity of the course and orient the topics of practical classes for students to fully assimilate the material and in-depth independent work, set new scientific tasks for students. Practical classes, in turn, can be conducted in the form of seminars or studio classes.</p>
        <p class="additionally">Laboratory classes are held only in a specially equipped room and serve as a link between theory and practice. They make it possible to deepen and consolidate the theoretical knowledge gained by students at lectures, to test scientific and theoretical positions experimentally, to get acquainted with equipment, devices and materials, to study in practice the methods of scientific research. Laboratory classes contribute to the formation of practical skills.</p>
        <p>Starting from the first year, and especially in the senior years, laboratory classes should develop the initiative and independence of students, whose work should take place under the guidance of teachers. In accordance with these main objectives, in order to improve the setting of laboratory classes, it should be:</p>
        <p class="additionally">- strengthening the connection with theoretical studies and deepening the scientific and ideological - theoretical basis of laboratory work;</p>
        <p class="additionally">- further approximation of laboratory classes to the requirements of continuously developing production;</p>
        <p class="additionally">- the development of initiative and independence of students in the process of performing laboratory work.</p>
        <p>Monitoring of students' academic achievements: current and boundary control (survey in the classroom, testing on the topics of the discipline, control work, protection of laboratory work, term papers, colloquiums, etc.);</p>
        <p>Intermediate certification/final control (testing by sections of the academic discipline, exam, defense of term papers and practice reports), final certification (protection of the thesis (project)</p>
